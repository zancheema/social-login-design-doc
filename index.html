                <p>
                    This is the Design Document for Authentication Client created using
                    Spring Boot Backend and React Frontend.

                    It elaborates the technologies and processes used to successfully enable a secure Authentication
                    for a user. So that only the authenticated user can access protected resource.

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The application features a protected resource, which is equivalent to any the dashboard of other
                    pages in a web application, which only authenticated user can view.</p>
                <p>Two types of authentications are implemented:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>username and password authentication</li>
                    <li>Oauth2 authentication with Github or Google</li>
                </ul>
                <div id="email-password-authentication">
                    <h3>Email and Password Authentication</h2>
                        <p>This type of authentication is two step process. First the user has to authorize the
                            credentials in the application's datastore. After that, the user can login with the provided
                            email and password.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="oauth2-authentication">
                    <h3>Oauth2 Authentication</h3>
                    <p>This is a single step authentication process. For this application, the user can authentication
                        with
                        Github and Google, but further third party authentication providers can be added. The user just
                        has
                        to login with their account without any signup and the rest is handled by the Oauth2
                        authentication
                        provider.</p>
                </div>

            <div id="processes">
                <h2>Processes</h2>
                <div id="Signup">
                    <h3>Signup</h3>
                    <p>The new user Signup's with three credentials, namely:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fullname</li>
                        <li>Email</li>
                        <li>Password</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These credentails are submitted at the Server endpoint, <strong>/auth/signup</strong>, where
                        these are registered in the application's users datastore. The stored credentials are userd for
                        authenticating the user credentials when logging in.
                    </p>
                    <p>The password is encoded by Password Encoder before being stored into the Datastore to improve the
                        security. This application uses Bycrypt Encoder as the password encoder, which is build into the
                        Spring Security framework. You can swap it with any other encoder of you choice.</p>

                                    in accout (Github or Google) provided the same email. It results in unsuccessful
                                    Signup
                                    request returning <strong>400 Bad Request</strong> status code.</p>

                        That's it for Signup. No complicated hash is returned and stored as cookies in signup.

                    <p>Login validates the user credentails and returns a token, which is stored by the client and is
                        used later to authenticate for access the protected resource. Login may pass or fail depending
                        on the user credentials. In case of failure, server returns status code <strong>403
                            Unauthorized</strong>, whereas status code <strong>200 OK</strong> is returned along with
                        the token if the login is successful.</p>

                        <p>User POST their Email and Password to the Server endpoint, <strong>/auth/login</strong>. The
                            server compares the provided email and password to the email and encrypted passord
                            registered in the datastore.</p>
                        <p>The credentials may be invalid or not even registered, the login request is failed in either
                            case.</p>
                        <p>If the credentials are valid, the server will generate an authentication token, <a
                                href="https://jwt.io">JSON Web Token</a> in this case. The token is saved by the client
                            and sent further requests to access the protected resource(s).</p>

                            In this type of Authentication, the validation is handled by OAuth2 provider, Google and
                            Github API in this case. The provider authenticates the user and provides the authenticated
                            user's credentials. These are used by the server to create and return the token.

                                <li>Client sends a <strong>GET</strong> request to
                                    <strong>/oauth2/authorize/&lt;provider&gt;</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li>The request gets redirected to the chosen OAuth2 provider's url by the server, which
                                    in this context acts as authentication client. Here the entire authentication
                                    process is handled by the provider.</li>
                                <li>On successful authentication, the authenticated credentials are returned to the
                                    server.</li>
                                <li>The server saves the new credentials in the database or updates the existing
                                    credentials if necessary with the provided credentials.</li>

                                    processing, the Server returns a <strong>200 OK</strong> status code to the client
                                    along with the generated token. The client stores the returned token in any form of
                                    browser storage.</li>

                        <p>
                            The client sends the request to access protected resource, this can be page in a web
                            application that requires authentication to access. In this example, it is the home page on
                            client, which makes GET Request to /user/me on server to get account information. This is
                            equivalent to viewing your profile on Facebook, for example.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The server checks for the provided access token (JWT in this case). If the token does not
                            exist, or it is invalid, the server returns 400 UNAUTHORIZED status code. After receiving
                            this response, the client is redirected to authenticate with valid credentials this time.
                            Contrary to that, if the token contains valid credentials, the server fetches stored client
                            data from the database and returns it as a JSON object. The Client uses this data to show
                            the profile information to the user.
